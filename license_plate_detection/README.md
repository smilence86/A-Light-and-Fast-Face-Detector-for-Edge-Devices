## License Plate (LP) Detection
We use the CCPD dataset introduced by paper [Towards End-to-End License Plate Detection and Recognition: A Large Dataset and Baseline](https://github.com/detectRecog/CCPD).

### Recent Update
* `2019.10.02` model v1 for CCPD dataset is released.

### Brief Introduction to Model Version
* v1 - is designed for CCPD dataset, covering LP scale [64, 512]. It has 3 branches. Please check 
`./symbol_farm/symbol_structures.xlsx` for details.

### Inference Latency

* Platform info: NVIDIA RTX 2080TI, CUDA 10.0, CUDNN 7.4.2, TensorRT 5.1.5.0

Model Version|320×240|640×480|1280×720|1920×1080|3840×2160|7680×4320
-------------|-------|-------|--------|---------|---------|---------
v1|0.62ms(1613.18FPS)|1.02ms(978.64FPS)|2.10ms(476.80FPS)|4.21ms(237.32FPS)|15.68ms(63.78FPS)|62.82ms(15.92FPS)

* Platform info: NVIDIA GTX 1060(laptop), CUDA 10.0, CUDNN 7.4.2, TensorRT 5.1.5.0

Model Version|320×240|640×480|1280×720|1920×1080|3840×2160
-------------|-------|-------|--------|---------|---------
v1|0.86ms(1167.71FPS)|1.83ms(546.00FPS)|4.45ms(224.63FPS)|9.68ms(103.27FPS)|37.59ms(26.60FPS)

> CAUTION: The latency may vary even in the same setting.

### Accuracy on CCPD Dataset
We use the latest CCPD dataset, containing 351,974 images (it is larger than the version described in the paper).
**Since the train/test split is not provided by the paper, we randomly select 3/5 data for training and the rest is for test.**
We train v1 on the training set (211,180 images) and evaluate on the test set (140,794 images). 

#### Quantitative Results on Test Set
Average Precision (AP) is used for measuring the accuracy. In detail, we use code [Object-Detection-Metrics](https://github.com/rafaelpadilla/Object-Detection-Metrics)
for calculating the AP metric. The following table presents the results:

> `The comparison is not fair due to different traning/test split. This is for reference only!`
>
> `We make only one inference for each image in test. So some extremely large plates are failed to detect.`
